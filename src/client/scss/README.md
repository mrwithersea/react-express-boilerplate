# CSS/SCSS Framework

## z-index

It is important to closely control the z-index usage in any large-scale application.

If you do use z-index, please record it here:

 - notifications.scss, .c-notification--overlay, 101
 - loading.scss, .c-loading, 100
 - site-logo.scss, .l-site__logo, 3
 - site-menu.scss, .l-site__menu, 3 (1 @ desktop)
 - ribbon.scss, .c-ribbon, 1
